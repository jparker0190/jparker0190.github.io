After finishing my undergrad a few years ago I went into the world of finance, getting my first entry-level position at a big bank in Pittsburgh, PA.  Like most entry-level positions it was wildly mundane and repetitive.  A majority of my day was updating databases and spreadsheets then reporting all of that at month end to uppper management. It was mind-numbing. After a month or two I started to tinker with writing macros and queries in both Excel and Access respectively. Boom! Game Changer.

I started recording macros and writing queries that would do most of my tasks on a daily basis cutting back on alot of my workload. Which led to some attention from my manager not that the queries or macros were anything new or innovative but that I took the iniative to figure it out and help the department run more efficiently. I soon would leave the company and move to the NYC area to work at a smaller trading firm in NJ that had just opened a new wealth management division and wanted help setting up the operations in that division. 

Here I took a lot of what I had picked up on the job at my company in Pittsburgh and applied it to the position at this firm. They had a fairly manual system in place that would help in getting the company by for reporting purposes but also had a lot of room for improvement and was not that sustainable as the company was currently undergoing a lot of growth and they would need to invest time in improving as trade volume continued to grow. 

My first task was to consolidate all of their spreadsheets that would hold past trade activity for each one of the investment vehicles they offered. I used my query and macro knowledge to not only speed up the process but to make it more accruate by letting the technology take over and get rid of the need to enter anything extensive manually. I was starting to realize the value in injecting technology into my work and soon took over all responsibility for their reporting systems and helped them set up their online precence by working with an outside developement firm for their sales literature.  

I used this experience to land my next position in Manhattan, NY working at a tech-heavy trading firm. Here I would be introduced to all kinds of challenges that the firm would solve on a daily basis through technology. It has been quite the learning experience surrounded by so many tech-heavy individuals. One as equally as smart as the other.
