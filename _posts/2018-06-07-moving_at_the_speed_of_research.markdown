Learning to code has been magnificent. 

Initially when I was trying to go at learning to code on my own I was under the impression, like most outside of programming I assume, that coding was typing ridicously fast on a keyboard in some editor to build out these big elaborate applications that you got an idea for one day.....I blame hollywood for a lot of this misconception.

But...that isn't reality sure the more I learn in ruby and the more I repeat some of the same task I begin to memorize a lot of the syntax but the amount of prep time that is needed before you begin any coding project pleasantly surprised me.  It's more about researching different functionality to complete the project effectively and efficiently than building it as fast as possible. 

Sure I have started to type really fast when building out my class structures and methods but only in the beginning after that most of it is prep, research and trial and error.  To my delight coding has become more of a continous research project that I will never 100% finish and will always learning each time I attempt it.
