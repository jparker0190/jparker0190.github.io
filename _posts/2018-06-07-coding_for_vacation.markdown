When I set up my plans for vacation each year one of the first things I think about is the logistics of the trip. What airliner will I need to take? What is the best route to the airport? Which week will work best? Who will cover my work at the office? Each layer of the process relies on the previous. 

Finding an affordable airline won't work unless its at an airport close to me and my destination which in turn won't work if I can not find a good week to take that allows for someone to cover my work in the office. Well thoughtout plan leads to smoother sailing when it actually comes time for me to take a break and enjoy vacation. 

I attribute a lot of this thinking to my practice of coding. Unless you think it through and first build-out the backend of a project or app your application will not function very well. Back-ends' of projects are the most crutial, the operations of any app have to be air-tight before you can begin on the front-end for the user and make it hip.
