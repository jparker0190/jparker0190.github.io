Object orientation is something that never really stuck with me when I was trying to understand what OO programming really was. I understood methods and classes but the idea of an object always escaped my understanding.

Reading different articles and attempting to go at it on my own and learn to code the idea of an object just seemed so foreign to me. I understood classes, just collections of methods, and methods, just a bunch of instructions, but objects? It wasn't until I started actually running labs and building things that my understanding of objects really started to make sense.
